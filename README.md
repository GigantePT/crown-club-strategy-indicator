This is the unofficial indicator used by the **Crown Club** community on TradingView.  
It automatically draws:
- 2 SMAs (50 SMA and 200 SMA by default, but you can change in the settings)
- Last Week's High and Low
- Last Week's Fibonacci Levels (0.500, 0.618 and 1.618) and the Golden Zone, based on the bias you set in the settings (Long or Short)
- Yesterday's High and Low
- Yesterday's Fibonacci Levels (0.500, 0.618 and 1.618) and the Golden Zone, based on the bias you set in the settings (Long or Short)

(On Mondays it does not draw Yesterday's High and Low and Fibonacci Levels)

It does not draw:
- FVGs
- Trend Lines

It works on multiple timeframes.
